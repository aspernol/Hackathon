# PIT Hackathon 2020 demo app
Just a small example app for the PIT hackathon 2020 based on the official firebase (auth and firestore) examples on pub.dev putting parts of them together.
A flutter app which connects to firebase and provides user registration and login and posting/deleting a 'Hello World' message with sync to all running instances of the app.

You have to provide your own google-services.json file in order to get the app working. See https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0 for a guideline how to do this.
